Australian Voting Problem:

Australian ballots require that voters rank all the candidates in order of choice. Initially only the first choices are counted, and if one candidate receives more than 50% of the vote then that candidate is elected. However, if no candidate receives more than 50%, all candidates tied for the lowest number of votes are eliminated. Ballots ranking these candidates first are recounted in favor of their highest-ranked non-eliminated candidate. This process of eliminating the weakest candidates and counting their ballots in favor of the preferred non-eliminated candidate continues until one candidate receives more than 50% of the vote, or until all remaining candidates are tied.
